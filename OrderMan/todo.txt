Partial Entry Fill - Handle Stop       // workaround - use SLM
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Handle cancel orders
Partial Stops
    Ex - Add Order Stop
        - Option to keep seperate
        - Merge when Normal stop moves past add stop
Option to change order type for open order
    - SL Order After Trigger - changes to Limit Order - should be editable ( unfilled )
    - Square Off - Market Stop order only if entry is complete - else cancel    // show cancel if not entered else squareoff
