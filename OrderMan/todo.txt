    Reset default ordertype after unlink/cancel


Bugs - Order creation box
    - Order creation - If not found - try to uncheck and check "Display All Orders" 
        // Once didnt show up until this
        // Another time - If OB is closed, reopen didnt show orders initially
    - Check and uncheck checkbox 
        - on every call to readOpenOrders()?
        - or maybe before looking for new order and if already open order is not found in open/completed lists

        ---------------------------
        NOW
        ---------------------------
        Please Select Order To Cancel
NT - pick from line in NT
    - Middle button brings tooltip  - Does not have value at cursor
    - Extend AB class   // keyword "extends"
Add Order Stop
    - Option to keep seperate
    - Merge when Normal stop moves past add stop

    Ring bell on Order Trigger
    Verify Order Creation/Updation - check size/status in callback
Max Slippage in GUI
Position Status - Current Risk based on Stop price / avg price
Log of Major Events - creation/updation/cancel/OrderTracker triggers - show in GUI ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partial Fill - Handle Stop/Target orders       // workaround - use SLM
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Handle cancel orders
Partial Target
    Move Target Order to seperate class? Maybe also for Entry and Stop
    Current target Order + List of Target executed orders
    _handleTargetOrder()
        target size should be less than position size
    save / load executed target orders
        linkOrders() - reduce position size for executed target orders
    OCO - trackerCallback - on target execution
        - reduce position size
        - update stop size using new position size, cancel only if size 0
Partial Square Off
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings - change in GUI
Linked Order Details
    - Expand Window after search
    - refresh button?
    - Add pending stop details to linked order

Constant Risk position sizing + Allow Risk %

    - SL Order After Trigger - changes to Limit Order - should be editable ( unfilled )
    - Square Off - Market Stop order only if entry is complete - else cancel    // show cancel if not entered else squareoff 
status bar - message updates + list
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAR
OCO Entry Orders
    - Cancel open order + its SL when other order Entry gets completed
    - Notify + cancel other if a entry order failed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug - MsgBox on top - gets overlapped by updateStatus() on show by Timer
Settings GUI - maybe add tabs for settings of other applications + option to change month/year in scripname
Link Orders
	- how to check Trading symbol against actual scrip - maybe take TradingSymbol as input in ini and use in other places too
	- Can use as filter in read orders - so will get applied to most functions
