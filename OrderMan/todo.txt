Bug
    SLM/Limit order, Only entry order made, stop target not made - If Entry order gets immediately executed    
    => Fast execution, straight to Completed => New order not found => Gives Error too - status empty
    
Use Entry average price for Target
FT, 50% size changes on price change
	Use some button to toggle full and half risk
    Also separate default target size    
Option for default target distance  // 1x 2x 3x etc 



    






































	

 
    


Bug
    - Update Target sometimes updates stop instead with bad qty
    - Add logs if not clear
    - check trackerCallback() -> this.target.isPartiallyFilled() 
        // commented - test
        // update flow conflicts with tracker thread ? 
        // if confirmed, change logic - just set position size and then update stop if needed
    - Code comment worked
Bug, SH - Multiple 'Trade Closed Verify', triggered when exit order takes multiple partial fills ? 
 

Button to open new order with current price
    - Stop order type and trade size % set and then 1 click to order    
Support Lot size
GUI calls from trade with GUI in different context can overwrite current context
    // Look if any calls left
    // for all, check how loadTradeToContext() loads data 


Order - Verify all fields after setting and before submit
    Maybe also verify after order creation
Current Status (Partial/Stop X) after Add ? What should it show ?
