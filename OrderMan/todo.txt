Bug
    - Update Target updated stop instead with bad qty
    - Add logs if not clear
    - check trackerCallback() -> this.target.isPartiallyFilled() 
        // commented - test
        // update flow conflicts with tracker thread ? 
        // if confirmed, change logic - just set position size and then update stop if needed
Bug, SH
    Limit order, Only entry order made, stop target not made
    Maybe if price close, perhaps Tracker does not catch it ? 
Bug, SH - Multiple 'Trade Closed Verify', triggered when exit order takes multiple partial fills ? 


 
   

    




















	

 
    
    





Use Entry average price for Target
FT, 50% size changes on price change
	Use some button to toggle full and half risk
    Also separate default target size
Support Lot size
GUI calls from trade with GUI in different context can overwrite current context
    // Look if any calls left
    // for all, check how loadTradeToContext() loads data 

 

Order - Verify all fields after setting and before submit
    Maybe also verify after order creation
Current Status (Partial/Stop X) after Add ? What should it show ?
