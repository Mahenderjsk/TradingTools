    Reset default ordertype after unlink/cancel
    Order creation - uncheck and check "Display All Orders"
    Target order not created by update if there is no existing target order
    Average Price - Adds + Link with adds



Bugs
    OrderLink 
        - Sets SLM order as Limit since its LIMIT after trigger
        - If Trigger Price != 0 
            If Price = 0 set SLM else SLL




Partial Target
    GUI - move current size to right of Entry + add Target size below
    Move Target Order to seperate class? Maybe also for Entry and Stop
    Current target Order + List of Target executed orders
    _handleTargetOrder()
        target size should be less than position size
    save / load executed target orders
        linkOrders() - reduce position size for executed target orders
    OCO - trackerCallback - on target execution
        - reduce position size
        - update stop size using new position size, cancel only if size 0
Square Off 
    - Market Stop order for filled position + cancel rest
        1) Update stop order Order Type in Entry structure
            - Set order type as market order
            - Dont update Order yet - (2) should do it
        2) Cancel open Entry order ( Add )
            This will also change stop qty to filled size

Partial Stops
Partial Fill - Handle Stop/Target orders       // workaround - use SLM
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Handle cancel orders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug - MsgBox on top - gets overlapped by updateStatus() on show by Timer
Settings GUI - maybe add tabs for settings of other applications + option to change month/year in scripname
Link Orders
	- how to check Trading symbol against actual scrip - maybe take TradingSymbol as input in ini and use in other places too
	- Can use as filter in read orders - so will get applied to most functions
