Price Status flickers empty sometimes, but sometimes stays steady
    priceUpdateCallback() - setPriceStatus()
    Maybe also call from updateStatus ? 
    
Bug
    Entry done, FT at 50 % size(13) and inital target 50% (7) of that
    Now update target price close to entry looking for exit
    This updated Target price but also updated stop size from 13 to 7 -> Bug
        => Stop size set to target size on target update, there was no Target/Stop fill and no cancel 
    target updated to 13 - But Stop size remains same at 7
    => Not sure when this happens, could not repeat 



 
   

    








Use Entry average price for Target
FT, 50% size changes on price change
	Use some button to toggle full and half risk
    Also separate default target size


Support Lot size
GUI calls from trade with GUI in different context can overwrite current context
    // Look if any calls left
    // for all, check how loadTradeToContext() loads data
