    Reset default ordertype after unlink/cancel


Entry Average price not updated   // Maybe remove anyway
NT - pick from line in NT
    - Middle button brings tooltip
    - Extend AB class   // keyword "extends"
Multiple Scrips 
    DropDown / Right Click
    1 ini per scrip (Some parts will be duplicate?) or 1 ini section per scrip





Multiple Orders
    - Example 2 orders long/short - OCO
    - One Order at a time
        - Keep array of trades + current context 
    - Context change
        - Option to create new separate trade
        - TradeChange - GUI
        - Switch context on Trade change
        - refresh orderbook too on context change + Filter all data for specific scrip - So everything else becomes per scrip
    - call trackerCallback() for each trade
        - Trade.reload() - Move orderbookObj.read(). Should be called only once here

    Automatic squareoff at 15:19
Take current price from RTDMan and show price, status

Log of Major Events - creation/updation/cancel/OrderTracker triggers
Bugs
    - Manual Link - Order type not updated 
    - Order creation - If not found - try to uncheck and check "Display All Orders" // Once didnt show up untill this
    - Cancel order - in between - gives error. Detect and check again
        ---------------------------
        NOW
        ---------------------------
        Please Select Order To Cancel

Partial Target
    Move to Target Order to seperate class? Maybe also for Entry and Stop
    Current target Order + List of Target executed orders
    _handleTargetOrder()
        target size should be less than position size
    save / load executed target orders
        linkOrders() - reduce position size for executed target orders
    OCO - trackerCallback - on target execution
        - reduce position size
        - update stop size using new position size, cancel only if size 0
Partial Square Off
Partial Fill - Handle Stop/Target orders       // workaround - use SLM
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Handle cancel orders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Settings - change in GUI
Linked Order Details
    - Expand Window after search
    - refresh button?
    - Add pending stop details to linked order
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constant Risk position sizing + Allow Risk %
Option to change order type for open order
    - SL Order After Trigger - changes to Limit Order - should be editable ( unfilled )
    - Square Off - Market Stop order only if entry is complete - else cancel    // show cancel if not entered else squareoff 
status bar - message updates + list
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAR
OCO Entry Orders
    - Cancel open order + its SL when other order Entry gets completed
    - Notify + cancel other if a entry order failed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug - MsgBox on top - gets overlapped by updateStatus() on show by Timer
Settings GUI - maybe add tabs for settings of other applications + option to change month/year in scripname
Link Orders
	- how to check Trading symbol against actual scrip - maybe take TradingSymbol as input in ini and use in other places too
	- Can use as filter in read orders - so will get applied to most functions
