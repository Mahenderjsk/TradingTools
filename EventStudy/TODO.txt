- settings helper ? 

- Multiple Runs
    - call in a loop?  Pass setting object to mechTM ?  Maybe no need to pass to pool.map. Just that the object used should not be a global variables
        May need to use this object everwhere         
    - tradelog as a package and read output array
    - or call externally
        - easiest way without making too many changes
        - option in tradelog to save output as pickle - should be small so no issue 
        - will need to pass settings ? Also as pickle ?         
   - check
        In case your main module imports another module in which global variables or class member variables are defined and initialized to (or using) some new objects, 
            you may have to condition that import in the same way:

        if __name__ ==  '__main__'':
          import my_module
    
    - Event Study - Multiple tests + aggregate 
          

- plugins - move each to a separate file within folder. Then can just import

- Option to take tradelog exit using exit time. Then can play with stop distance while keeping discretionary exit
    - To check if discretionary initstop is harming result        
    
- Initial Stop
    - Use the highest ATR in last 20/30 bars
    - Add to Notes
        - seems worse reduces returns without improving max DD. Stop hit reduces but does not help net
        - probably because it applies to all trades and not selectively to only problem trades
- Dynamic stop 
    - Manually look for stops that are too tight and try to find condition to identify. MaybeST vol vs long term vol
        - Then increase multiple or use LTF vol
        - ATR(5) / ATR(60)  - or prob 20/50    10/50
        - Add condition to event itself and check if we can improve it
        - This might work as it will be targeted to the problem vs apply for all in case of max atr
    - Trail - identify consolidation   
        - Say Look at overall range of last 3-5 bars vs some atr
        
- approx 1 swing trail

- Compressed - squeeze
    The “TTM Squeeze” (popularized and marketed by John Carter) can be reduced to the simple ratio of StdDev(Close) / ATR.
    I think it makes more sense to simply compare StdDev(C,n) to its own longer-term average than to arbitrarily compare it to ATR 
        Or even simpler, use something like Highest(C,n) / Lowest(C,n) (or use H and L if you prefer)
		I like to find the simplest way to express a concept
-------------

- Mech - better - try with entry on touch, ie entry at the level at BO price. Will reduce slippage + better price vs close










-------
Event Study Nifty, Stocks, Open hour, Close hour - PDH/PDL - Off Open movement
    Is 1m trending in the Short term ? 
        So can look at ST momentum on BO and on Failure
    Futures Premium adjustment using F2
    Unger style - BO of PDH/PDL to check if MR or Trending
Currencies
    - USD/EUR/GBP/JPY + INR
    - Small contract size + low volatility => large size. So should be able to trade with small capital
    - 9 to 5
    - Dont have intraday data - But can test on Daily. Later also try on 4H. Also verify against global pairs
    - No STT
-------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




    
- TD yesterday  - morning vs afternoon trades with current TM
    - High SS + Good close vs range
    - Also check against TD/some trend against  - reversal 
    - NR7 yesterday etc
    - TD in stock yesterday
    - Nifty TD yesterday
    - Sum(SS) over last 3/4 days


- Upsampling
    # Monthly Data to Daily
        series.resample('D')    
    # This will set only the first row
        Month
        1901-01-01 266.0
        1901-01-02 NaN
        1901-01-03 NaN
        1901-01-04 NaN
        1901-01-05 NaN
        1901-01-06 NaN
        1901-01-07 NaN
        ...
        1901-01-30 NaN
        1901-01-31 NaN
        1901-02-01 145.9
    # Then Fillna using bfill
        pandas.DataFrame.fillna()
      Also keep only market time range

     
    
    
------------------------
- Trade with Nifty trend
    - When nifty trending and trades aligned with Nifty trend    
        - VERIFY trades
        - add to notes - UT works, DT does not ? shorter Lookback ?
        - Filter to do same - can use for tradelogs
    - When Nifty trending and new H/L made in last X bars
    - Nifty above PDH/below PDL
      Nifty above/below open

- Market Breadth + other aggregate stats    











---------------------------------------------MECHTM-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prices are not adjusted to TICK, just assuming it will average out - check 

Mechanical - option to remove multiple simultaneous signals
    - Quick fix 
        - Set trade close time in output
        - before exporting csv, loop row by row. For each trade look ahead and check if future trade is within current trades window. Skip future trade if within window
        - maybe can do in array too, similar to signals.signalFilter
    - Only Add when working ? 

Multiple tests in one go
    - Pass array of setting as input. Can set up first + clone + change some (including output file)
    - Extra loop in processScrips + output changes to tuple of arrays(or similar), one element for each setting
    - Add up respective arrays from tuple and call tradelog for each - can maybe call tradelog multiple times in parallel
    - Also, can maybe get Tradelog output as df and then do more stuff on top of it
        - Show results by time of day. separate into shorts, longs. Diff between few settings .. 
        - Per stock stats - say rank by mean returns

Tradelog - Set Qty to capital%
    - Will probably need loop as qty and capital depend => should be configurable option
    - Then can show capital in Equity curve instead of X returns - This will show big dips more clearly with compounding
    - Can have separate helper main to set qty in log

time stops    
    Try cycle's methods
        1. If price dips below the entry price,  use the distance between the low of the bar and the entry price to ‘pull down’ the limit
        2. take the difference between today’s close and yesterday’s close as the basis for tightening the limit            
            If today’s close is lower than yesterday’s, we subtract that difference from where the limit is, otherwise we leave the limit where it is
            Unlike system 1 this can be cumulative, so if the next day price goes up but the day after that price drops again, we then subtract that second drop as well
            In this way we gradually home in on price if it’s just chopping around
            Don’t allow tightening beyond breakeven, this is positive if price has been chopping around or moving against our position
         This system produces a win rate of something around 60-75% and a loss rate of 20-35% with the rest being breakeven 
			- Losses average pretty much -1R and wins average 0.7R
			- The system is profitable in most circumstances (over a large number of trades) due to the higher win rate
MechSignals
    - tune
        - Filter out very extended ? 
            + high SS BO close ? Seems to help for longs but not for shorts - check mech 5 year
        - Look for good consolidation ? 
        - Filter out if high SS against in say last 10 bars?    
        - Aligned with index ? - Ex Afternoon short signal in Index    
    - profile - indicators.atr(ema/ewma) - takes up 40%. can try over numpy ( df.values ) but no ewma

    - By year/Month- Also by Time
    - option to compile stats for each stock
    - get outlier stocks. So best stocks and stocks that have reverse tendency
- Setting to change Returns logic - Ex use open price ( signals on open ), on BO.
    - vol adjusted SS returns ?
    - To compare results of different signals. Ex High SS gives Higher MR in % but that is due to higher vol
    - But what about Baseline? - Adding up all days SS / # ?
    - alternate - maybe just do mean/stddev to get similar idea
- Plot candlestick chart
    Can also dump charts with recent signals as scanner. Or just open up with option to move between trades

- FT + combinations - spike / momentum / nbar approach
     sig.trendUp() & sig.FTShort()
- Trend + out of character move against - macd / Highest SS in recent history. Check returns
    - Reluctant bounce - how ? - Do bar by bar checks
    - climax ?
- Strong trends ? High band close ratio
- Donchian - try PDH-PDL filters
- Donchian on BO
    - use H/L instead of C as trigger
    - Need to set Entry price as BO price + handle gaps beyond entry price
- ind - PDH,PDL, KPOS, NR7, ID5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Gap fade + check gap after n day run vs gap after consolidation
    # Bar open is lower than previous bar close by x%
    # TODO - returns from open
    def largeGapDown( scrip, bars ):
        signal = ( bars['O'] / bars['C'].shift(1) )  <= 0.97
        return  signal

        signal = ( bars['O'] / bars['C'].shift(1) )  >= 1.03
        return  signal
- Daily - Large Move MR
    check - v sharp move leads to some followthrough next day before mean reversion sets in ( Day 1 continuation and later some revesal ? )
    Large Moves vs moderate moves
    Trend Day vs less decisive days
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Pullback
    Verify PB with ema close
    Momentum filter in KB PB
    MACD - New momentum H/L + MACD Hook - Momentum change - in Pullbacks
        say Highest 5 bar momentum + say prev bar high broken
    Try to filter out breaks from low volatility conditions or include for momentum
        check long vs short term vol say 60/10 etc
        Inside bars, ID5, NR7
- Price consolidating at KB say - KPOS of prev 5 bars > 0.85
     check long vs short term vol say 60/10 etc
     Inside bars, ID5, NR7
     check with SS filter
     Extended trend + KB touch - check PBs here
- Volatility - T vs CT
    NR7, ID5
    Can also look at say 2bar/3bar overall range against say around 10 bar
